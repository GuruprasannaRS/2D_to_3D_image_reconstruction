# 2D_to_3D_image_reconstruction

•	Compared and evaluated technical features of SIFT, SURF, ORB, and AKAZE feature descriptor algorithms for the Pancreas CT dataset.
•	Employed RANSAC algorithm to eliminate outliers and improved accuracy of feature matching over 90%
•	Determined that ORB was the most efficient algorithm for matching inner features. Ensembled ORB with other algorithms and utilized the resulting features in 3D image reconstruction using the 3D Cloud Point technique.
